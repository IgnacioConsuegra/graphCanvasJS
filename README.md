Hello, this repository contains projects I did to learn at least the basics of HTML canvas.

Each branch contains a different project.

There are 4 branches in total: main, personalThings, testTree, windowsBurble.

main: Particle creation at mouse position.

personalThings: Interconnected nodes forming something similar to a graph.

testTree: Binary tree with depth and breadth-first traversal, it's a visualizer.

windowsBurble: My attempt to recreate the bubbles from the Windows screensaver.
